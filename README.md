A simple <b>console-based Blood Bank program written in C</b> that stores donor information using file handling. Uses only <code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</code> — no extra libraries needed.

# ⚙️ How The Program Works

The program runs inside an **infinite loop** using:

```c
while(1)
```

This continuously shows the menu until the user selects **Exit**.

---

## 1️⃣ Add Donor

The program asks the user to enter:

* Name
* Age
* Blood Group
* Contact Number
* Blood Expiry Date

Example input:

```text
Enter Name: Rahul
Enter Age: 20
Enter Blood Group (e.g. A+, O-): O+
Enter Contact Number: 9876543210
Enter Blood Expiry Date (DD/MM/YYYY): 15/06/2025
```

Then the program checks:

```c
if(age >= 18)
```

If the donor is **18 or older**, they are eligible to donate blood.

The data is then saved to:

```
bloodbank.txt
```

Example stored data:

```text
Rahul 20 O+ 9876543210 15/06/2025
Priya 22 A+ 9123456789 20/07/2025
Aman 19 B+ 9000012345 10/08/2025
```

---

## 2️⃣ View Donors

The program reads data from **bloodbank.txt** and displays it like this:

```text
Name: Rahul | Age: 20 | Blood Group: O+ | Contact: 9876543210 | Expiry: 15/06/2025
Name: Priya | Age: 22 | Blood Group: A+ | Contact: 9123456789 | Expiry: 20/07/2025
```

---

## 3️⃣ View Total Blood Types

The program reads all donors and counts how many of each blood type are available:

```text
--- Total Blood Types Available ---
A+  : 2
A-  : 0
B+  : 1
B-  : 1
AB+ : 3
AB- : 0
O+  : 4
O-  : 1
```

Uses **character indexing** to match each donor's blood group — no extra library needed:

```c
if(blood[0]=='A' && blood[1]=='+' && blood[2]=='\0') Apos++;
```

- `blood[0]` → first character (e.g. `A`, `B`, `O`)
- `blood[1]` → second character (e.g. `+`, `-`, `B`)
- `blood[2]=='\0'` → checks the string ends there (so `A+` doesn't accidentally match `AB+`)

---

## 4️⃣ Exit

Stops the program using:

```c
break;
```

# 📚 Important C Commands Explained

## `printf()`

Prints output to the console.

```c
printf("Hello World");
```

---

## `scanf()`

Reads input from the user.

```c
scanf("%d", &age);
```

---

## `FILE *fp`

Creates a **file pointer** used for file operations.

---

## `fopen()`

Opens a file.

```c
fp = fopen("bloodbank.txt", "a");
```

File modes:

| Mode | Meaning                   |
| ---- | ------------------------- |
| `r`  | Read file                 |
| `w`  | Write / overwrite         |
| `a`  | Append (add data to file) |

---

## `fprintf()`

Writes formatted data to a file.

```c
fprintf(fp, "%s %d %s %s %s\n", name, age, blood, contact, expiry);
```

---

## `fscanf()`

Reads formatted data from a file.

```c
fscanf(fp, "%s %d %s %s %s", name, &age, blood, contact, expiry);
```

---

## Character Indexing

Since we only use `stdio.h`, instead of `strcmp()` we check blood groups **character by character**:

```c
if(blood[0]=='A' && blood[1]=='+' && blood[2]=='\0')
    Apos++;
```

Arrays in C work like this — each character is stored at a position starting from `0`. The special character `'\0'` marks the **end of the string**.

---

## NULL Check

Before reading a file, we check if it opened successfully:

```c
if(fp == NULL)
{
    printf("No donors found!\n");
    continue;
}
```

This prevents the program from **crashing** if the file doesn't exist yet.
